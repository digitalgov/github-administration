#### Creating a GitHub account

For a user who hasn't yet created a GitHub account, follow these directions:  

1. If you haven't created a GitHub account yet (https://github.com/), do so with your government email, which will assist with [records retention](http://ben.balter.com/open-source-for-government/#records).  
2. If you already have a GitHub account, simply [add your goverment email to your existing account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/). Do not create a new account. You can also set up custom email routing through the [Notifications Center](https://github.com/settings/notifications). Make sure your commits are [associated with your government email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git).
3. Update the `Settings` in your account to match the [GSA Standards](#gsa-standards).
4. Note that associating commits with an email address is different from [setting notifications to go to one or another email address](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-notification-emails-for-organizations/). You also have to change the official commit email address attached to each repo.
5. If youâ€™re using your work computer for personal projects on GitHub and want your personal email tied to those commits, you can set your GSA email as part of the global `.gitconfig`, then [override on a repository level](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) with your personal email. If you have both emails [in your GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), though, they will both be tied to your GitHub account.
6. Make sure you have [notifications turned on](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and make sure your notifications are set up they way you'd like them.

#### Requesting access to the GSA organization

1. Ensure that you have created a GitHub account that matches the standards above.  
2. If your group already has a team in the GSA organization, ask your point of contact to email 'gsa-github.support@gsa.gov' with your Github username and request that you be given access.  
3. If your group does not yet have a team in the GSA organization, email 'gsa-github.support@gsa.gov' to coordinate a team be created.  You will need to list the usernames of any others who should be added.   
4. You will receive a notification when you've been given access.  

#### Creating new repositories

1. At https://github.com/digitalgov, Click `+ New Repository`.  
2. When choosing the repo's name, try to pick [a simple and useful name](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/naming-your-project/)
3. Include a brief description of the project.  
4. Change the repo status to `Public` unless it does must be private.  
5. It is usually convenient to check the box to `Initialize this repository with a README`.  
6. You will usually not need to worry about adding a `.gitignore`.  
7. Please choose the type of license from the dropdown.  For a description of the license types, see https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository  
8. Click Create Repository
9. If prompted, choose the most appropriate team that you are a member of that should be given permission to the repo.
